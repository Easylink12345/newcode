#IN PYTHON PROGRAMMING, THEY ARE TWO MAJOR LOOPS
#1.  while LOOPS
# THE for LOOPS
# In python, a while loop is used to exercute a block of statement repeatedly untill a giving condition is satisfied

#EXAMPLE # -*- coding: latin-1 -*-

count = 0
while (count<5):
    count = count+1
    print("Ayobami is a star")
    
    
    
# WHILE LOOP WITH AN ELSE statement
count = 0
while(count <=4):
    count = count+1
    print("He is a young STAR")
else:
    print("That guy is old men!!")
    
# THE INFINITE WHILE LOOP
initial = 0
while(initial == 2):
    print(2*2)
else:
    print("AYOBAMI WHY?")
    
# PYTHON FOR LOOP
n = 6
for i in range(0, n):
    print(i)
    
print("List iteration")
l = ("good boy", "for", "Life")
for i in l:
    print(i)
